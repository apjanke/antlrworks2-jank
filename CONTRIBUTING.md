# Contributor Agreement (required for pull requests)

While the ANTLRWorks2-Jank project is open source under the LGPL license, new contributions
back to this project which contain code must be made available to Tunnel Vision
Laboratories, LLC under the terms of the MIT license. (This is a condition of the
original ANTLRWorks 2 project.)

## What does this mean?

This means Tunnel Vision Laboratories, LLC (and anybody else) can do the following 
with code contributed back to the project from the open source community:

1. Include the code in future ANTLRWorks 2 releases.
2. Include the code, in original or modified form, in other products created by Tunnel
   Vision Labs, **including closed-source products**.

## How do I agree to these terms?

To agree to these terms, sign the contributing agreement in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and
include the change as a signed commit with your pull request. Please 
[GPG-sign your commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)
that adds you to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

* You only need to sign the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file prior to the first time you
  submit a pull request (or include it as part of the pull request itself).
* The submitter of a pull request which adds a user to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file
  *must* match the user information which was added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
  For example, only @sharwell can send a pull request containing a commit which adds
  @sharwell to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
