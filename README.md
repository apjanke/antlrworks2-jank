ANTLRWorks2-Jank is [apjanke](https://apjanke.net)'s fork of ANTLRWorks.
Development has stalled upstream since Terrence Parr and the other developers are focusing on IntelliJ and other IDE plugins now.
So I thought I'd pick up the code and see if I can get it running, since I'm curious about ANTLRWorks.
This is not an official ANTLR project!

## Background

The last upstream release of ANTLRWorks on GitHub was version 2.5.3 in September 2016, and targeted NetBeans 8.1.
The head of `master` in upstream is targeting NetBeans 8.2 and ANTLR 4.6.
As of January 2020, NetBeans has transitioned to Apache and is now up to version 11, and ANTLR is up to 4.8.

## Status

I'm currently still working on just getting the project to build under NetBeans 11 and my development setup.

## Author and Support

ANTLRWorks2-Jank is maintained by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net).

Don't contact the ANTLR folks about this project!
They won't know what you're talking about.
